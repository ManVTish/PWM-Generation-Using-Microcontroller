PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is basically an anlaog signal produced from digital source. Since it's analog it is continuous and the fact that it can vary is controlled 
by two parameters : dutyCycle and timePeriod. Duty-cycle is important from the aspect that it controls how much (voltage/any signal) to be delivered. It ranges from 0-1.
But why do we even need PWM pulses in the first place?
  Let me put it this way, suppose I connect a dc motor to a 9V dc battery (let us take only these 2 for now) and the motor shaft runs, but I want the speed to be less.
So I disconnect the motor from battery, but it slows down very fast (far less speed than I need). If I continuously connect and disconnect the dc motor from the battery
the speed will be less than what it would have been if it stays connected.
   AGAIN, THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO CONTROL SPEED OF MOTOR AS I KNOW FROM MY ELECTRICAL MACHINE COURSE.
So PWM comes into picture. It does the same continuous switching and to be precise, it controls the duration of switch ON/OFF i.e, dutyCycle. Furthermore, time-period 
decides how fast the switching takes place.
